- UI to add roast details
- View saved roasts
- Labels for chart axis
- Settings view (Eureka?)
  - BT/ET probe selection
  - Temps for roast phases (https://artisan-scope.org/docs/phases/)
- How/when to disconnect from device (when it's off/btn0?)
- Optimize live plotting (collect BT + ET before refreshing?)

HW:
x Report temp in LSB (0.25C)
- LED to indicate connection / SPI reads
- Turn on using RST
- Turn off/sleep hold BTN-0

Features:
